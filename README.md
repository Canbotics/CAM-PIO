Canbotics Asset Manager: Python Image Organizer

## Goals
Python based app, which catalogues uploaded images:

1) Retrieve images from an S3 bucket
2) Read and store pertinent information in a MySQL database
3) Move the original image - and a thumbnail - to a storage drive

And manipulate images:

1) Create multiple formats - as required
2) Properly name and place files (based on domain) for programmatic access
